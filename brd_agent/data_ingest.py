BRD Agent - Data Ingestion Module (Module 1)
=============================================
Handles loading, preprocessing, and chunking data from multiple sources.

SUPPORTED DATASETS:
  📧 Enron Email Dataset   - CSV from Kaggle (Public Domain)
  🎙️ AMI Meeting Corpus    - HuggingFace datasets (CC BY 4.0)
  📝 Meeting Transcripts   - CSV from Kaggle

FEATURES:
  - Multi-format parsing (emails, transcripts, chats)
  - Noise filtering via regex + keyword matching
  - Sliding window chunking for LLM input
  - Synthetic chat generation from email threads
  - Entity extraction (dates, names) from headers

HOW TO USE:
  from brd_agent.data_ingest import DataIngestionEngine
  engine = DataIngestionEngine()
  emails = engine.load_enron("path/to/emails.csv")
  ami = engine.load_ami()  # auto-downloads from HuggingFace
  processed = engine.preprocess_noise(raw_text)
  chunks = engine.chunk_text(long_text)

Following up on the platform migration discussion. Here are the confirmed requirements:

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. All user data must be migrated with zero data loss - this is non-negotiable
2. The new platform must support SSO via SAML 2.0 and OAuth 2.0
3. API backward compatibility must be maintained for at least 6 months
4. Real-time data synchronization between old and new systems during transition

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- System uptime: 99.95% SLA during migration period
- Page load time: < 2 seconds for 90th percentile
- Support for 10,000 concurrent users (up from current 5,000)

TIMELINE:
- Phase 1 (Data Migration): Complete by March 30, 2026
- Phase 2 (API Migration): Complete by April 30, 2026
- Phase 3 (Full Cutover): Target May 15, 2026

STAKEHOLDERS:
- Executive Sponsor: VP of Engineering (Mark Thompson)
- Product Owner: Jennifer Wu
- Tech Lead: Raj Patel
- QA Lead: Lisa Chen

RISK: The vendor contract for the legacy system expires June 1. No extension possible.

Decision from yesterday's meeting: We'll use a blue-green deployment strategy.

Please review and flag any blockers by EOD Friday.

Thanks,
Jennifer""",

The security audit for Project Omega has been completed. Key findings that affect requirements:

CRITICAL FINDINGS (Must fix before launch):
1. SQL injection vulnerability in the search API - Requirement: Implement parameterized queries
2. Missing rate limiting on authentication endpoints - Requirement: Add rate limiting (max 100 req/min)
3. Sensitive data stored in plaintext - Requirement: Encrypt at rest using AES-256

HIGH PRIORITY:
4. No CSRF protection on form submissions - Timeline: Fix by Feb 28
5. API keys exposed in client-side code - Timeline: Move to server-side by March 5

STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK:
- CTO: "Critical items are launch blockers. No exceptions."
- Legal: "GDPR compliance is mandatory. Data encryption is not optional."
- Product: "Can we phase the high-priority items post-launch?" 
- Security Lead: "I disagree with Product's suggestion - all items should be pre-launch."

This represents a CONFLICT between Product and Security priorities. 
Escalation meeting scheduled for Feb 20.

Decision Needed: Budget approval for 2 additional security engineers ($50K/month).

Regards,
Security Team""",

Based on customer interviews and stakeholder feedback, here's the Phase 2 scope:

USER STORIES:
- As a customer, I want to view my order history so I can track past purchases
- As an admin, I want to generate reports so I can analyze business metrics
- As a customer, I want to receive email notifications for order status changes

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
1. Order history page loads within 1.5 seconds
2. Reports can be exported in CSV and PDF formats
3. Email notifications sent within 30 seconds of status change

DEPENDENCIES:
- Requires completion of Phase 1 authentication module
- Needs integration with third-party email service (SendGrid)

TIMELINE:
- Sprint 1 (Feb 24 - Mar 7): Order history backend + frontend
- Sprint 2 (Mar 10 - Mar 21): Reporting engine
- Sprint 3 (Mar 24 - Apr 4): Notifications + testing

BUDGET: Approved $25,000 for external API integrations

Let me know if any of these requirements need clarification.

Engineer (Tom): The redesign requires a complete rewrite of the navigation component. I estimate 4 weeks for the frontend, plus 2 weeks for API optimization.

Designer (Maya): I have the new wireframes ready. Key change: we're moving from a hamburger menu to a bottom tab navigation. User testing showed 40% faster task completion.

PM (Sarah): Great. Second priority is the analytics dashboard. Stakeholder requirement from the CEO.

Engineer (Tom): We need to decide on the charting library. I recommend Plotly for interactive charts, but it adds 200KB to the bundle.

QA (James): I want to raise a concern. We still have 15 open bugs from Q1. The requirement was to close all P1 bugs before new feature work.

PM (Sarah): Valid point. Decision: We'll allocate the first week of Q2 exclusively to bug fixes. Tom, can you prioritize?

Engineer (Tom): Sure. But I need clarity on the performance requirement - what's the target page load time?

PM (Sarah): Stakeholder requirement: under 3 seconds on 3G networks. 

Engineer (Tom): That's aggressive with the current architecture. We might need to implement lazy loading and code splitting.

Designer (Maya): Timeline concern - the design hand-off for the analytics dashboard won't be ready until March 15.

PM (Sarah): Noted. Let's adjust the timeline. Analytics dashboard moves to Sprint 3 instead of Sprint 2.

Scrum Master: What didn't go well?

Dev A (Priya): The requirement to support real-time streaming was added mid-sprint. This caused scope creep and we couldn't finish the batch processing optimization.

Product Owner (Nina): I take responsibility for that. The client escalated and we had to accommodate.

Dev B (Alex): Agreed. Also, the code review process is a bottleneck. Requirement: all PRs must be reviewed within 4 hours during business hours.

Scrum Master: Stakeholder feedback from the client: they're happy with the throughput but concerned about data freshness. The requirement is data no older than 15 minutes.
